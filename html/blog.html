    Art Vs Capitalism
</h1>

<div class="class container-fluid m-2 p-5 text-justify">
    A lot of people, particularly millennials and members of Gen-Z, are disillusioned with or have lost faith in capitalism. They contend that the free market economy merely renders people into mindless drones enslaved to serve the interests of corporations in power. People who oppose capitalism frequently hold the opinion that it is solely to blame for all of society's ills. They are under the belief that bribery with money or power may effectively quiet the victims of corruption and mask it. Additionally, they are under the firm belief that it requires the wealthy but not wealthy enough individuals to participate in the rat race of society, where individuals are required to be more creative, clever, and cunning in order to make their ends meet. This leads to a situation where people are forced to balance various part-time jobs while trying to earn their daily bread under difficult times. Having said that, it is becomes important to acknowledge that one cannot effectively support oneself in modern society without being subject to capitalism's dictates. Many people, especially non-artists, have the regrettable misconception that art and culture somehow existed in a Utopia outside of this kind of capitalism. This raises the question of how much capitalism influences art. 
In an article in response to John Molyneux’ The Dialectics of Art, political activist and author Chris Nineham argues that having to create and present art to an audience that will privately consume it not only puts a lot of pressure on an individual artist but also stifles their creativity. He agrees with John when he said that all art produced under a capitalist society is circumstantial. However, he believes “Once their work is produced even partially in response to external necessities, the artist is no longer in control of their own creativity”.

<b>Does capitalism or creating art to meet the egoistical needs of people in positions of power stifle creativity?  </b> <br> <br>
Take for example, the art work produced during the Baroque period. In 1517, when Martin Luther questioned basic tenets of the Roman Church, including the ‘clergy’s exclusive right to grant salvation’, the church carefully curated and commissioned the Baroque art movement as an advertising campaign to systematically target the uneducated masses through art. The Baroque movement was a classic attempt to reinstate the catholic church’s fundamental teachings and combat the protestant criticism that turned the public against the catholic church. This could be evidently traced in the way the artworks from Baroque were created. Works of art created in the Baroque period were known to be dramatic, divine and vivid contrary to that of Renaissance. The artists were tasked to install a sense of belonging and connection to the divine inside the hearts of common people. To bring that out they created a sense of movement and made use of light and shadow in order to create dramatic realism. This, arguably required artists to use their creativity thus diminishing the point raised by Chris Nineham and the argument in question. 
Similar examples of using art as a means to convince common folks about certain beliefs of the government or the church can be seen in early art movements like the Renaissance or Gothic art period as well. <br>

<b> Do consumerism and monetisation of art kill people’s passion for art that leads to its ultimate ‘decline’ ? </b>
<br> <br>
A lot of younger generation artists or people who converted their 
passion into their profession have begin to question whether they made the right choice. Majority of them can’t seem to remember how long it has been since they created art just because they wanted to. Surely, this is purely based on personal experience and one would rather pursue something they love doing than something they could care less about, right? Or perhaps, contentment is just another lie invented by capitalism and had they taken the decision to pursue something outside of their passion – professionally, that too would have bored them within a matter of time. This brings society under a catch-22 situation. But the answer perhaps lies in the discussion below:
<br> <br>
In his book, Art after Money, Money after Art: , Max Haven expresses “We imagine that art and money are old enemies, but this myth actually reproduces a violent system of global capitalism and prevents us from imagining and building alternatives.” Through his book, he explains how everything that holds value in the society is commodified, commercialised or monetised – including art or rather especially art – which in many ways is sadly true.
<br>
<br>
Maybe the monotony of earning a career through art has also contributed to its reaction. Perhaps, this was exactly the point of argument, Andy Warhol, a well-known contemporary Pop-Art artist, tried to make. The term ‘Pop-art’ conjures up images of vivid, strong colours, repetitions, and screen printing. Additionally, it  flashes pictures of commercialised idols and objects like soup cans or Coca-Cola bottles. Even though the artworks were beautiful, bold and eye-catching to some, many others started to wonder why repeated screen prints of soup cans were valued so highly. Critics of Pop-art called  Warhol out for being a ‘lazy artist’. However, what many failed to realise was that Warhol was perhaps just being satirical when he used his work and the creative process in a "lazy" manner. This, however, does not exclude him from becoming a consumerist himself. He was, in a way, criticising consumerism while also being satirical and mocking society. At the same time, by creating consumerist artworks and by earning a living off of his "lazy art.", he perhaps also demonstrates that, despite its sinister origins, Consumerism still continues to be a part of who he is. This raises another question.

<b>Is it ethical to shame artists for willingly being employed or enslaved by those in power? </b>
<br> <br>
There are numerous instances of resistance to capitalism. A prime example of modern art that rebelled against capitalism while still assisting artists in making ends meet is the Dada movement. One of the post popular dada work of art that explained and criticised capitalism is ‘the Art Critic’ by Raoul Hausmann. Through the Art Critic, he expressed how the critics of modern art (his central subject) only see what those in higher sections of the society (like the woman to his right) want them to see. Thus, he contended that any words that come out of the critics controlled by the rich and powerful are irrelevant to him. He chooses to represent his disapproval of capitalism in a way that critics of modern art claim ‘makes no sense’ thus living upto the fundamental meaning of the Dadaism. He represented the critic with large sloppy eyes holding a comically large pencil that depicts the unfair power a critic’s words holds over an artist – thus creating a chaotic presentation of his feelings. He did not like for those with money to have a great amount of control, whether it be of art or other aspects of society. 
<br>
<br>
While Raoul Haussmann provided a fantastic example of rebellion against capitalism, for up-and-coming artists, it's critical to keep in mind that capitalism promotes the idea that greed is admirable. Therefore, regardless of whether the cause their advocating is moral or unethical, everyone employed in a capitalist system implicitly participates in their employers' efforts to increase profits. In fact, many a times, artists are usually unaware of the various unfair activities that may have occurred behind the scenes of the campaign they are promoting when they are hired or coerced via art-washing. Just because, Haussman was content with making money by criticising capitalism, it does not entail that every other artist must follow his philosophy. It requires a lot of guts to rebel against those in power and not everyone is prepared to face the consequences. Thus, it is not fair to shame artists for merely co-existing with capitalism.
<br>
<br>
Ironically enough, there have also been instances of anti-capitalist protests that have targeted well-known and expensive works of art. The protest staged by two members of the Just Stop Oil movement on October 14, 2022 in London was a relatively recent example of this. After gluing themselves to the wall and hurling soup cans at Van Gogh's famous "Sunflowers" painting, one of the protesters yells:  "What is worth more, art or life? Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet and people?" she asks. The protest went viral and faced massive backlash. Many argued that the protest was hypocritical since glue is itself a by product of the oil industry. Others pointed out how the protesters themselves wasted cans of soup while talking about people starving. While their arguments were valid they fail to see that their actions did in fact grab the attention of masses. Perhaps, it was never about destroying a painting. The protestors were in fact very careful and ensured that the painting they targeted was covered with glass. It was just a means to spotlight a much larger issue regarding mass consumption and vulnerability of ecologies.

Artist Joanie Lemercier covers this beautifully through an Instagram video. He gives users of social media his reaction to the viral protest from an artists point of view. While he agrees that art is important and cultural heritage is esteemed, he emphasises that it is still important to question the serious problems that exist in the value system. He condemns that the estimation of Van Gogh’s Sunflowers, while a beautiful work of art, at 80 million dollars is “completely detached from reality and  a product of hyper speculation and monetisation of art into financial assets.”

    The purpose of this case study was to establish that commodification of art under capitalism definitely influences art to an extent where it kills people’s fuel for creating art just because they want to. However, as Chris puts it, “The story of the artist ‘selling out’ to the system has become a commonplace. However well they handle it, artists cannot escape their contradictory situation” This, reinstates the point made in the above discussions.
In conclusion, no matter how much artists try to conquer commodification of art, their product will be commodified. As long as they enjoy doing what they do and make a living out of it, there doesn’t seem to be any problem. It is important to remember that it is the same capitalism that employs artists and provides them with regular income.
