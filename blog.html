    Art Vs Capitalism
</h1>

<br>

<div class="class container-fluid m-2 text-justify">
    A lot of people, particularly millennials and members of Gen-Z, are disillusioned with or have lost faith in capitalism. They contend that the free market economy merely renders people into mindless drones enslaved to serve the interests of corporations in power. People who oppose capitalism frequently hold the opinion that it is solely to blame for all of society's ills. They are under the belief that bribery with money or power may effectively quiet the victims of corruption and mask it. Additionally, they are under the firm belief that it requires the wealthy but not wealthy enough individuals to participate in the rat race of society, where individuals are required to be more creative, clever, and cunning in order to make their ends meet. This leads to a situation where people are forced to balance various part-time jobs while trying to earn their daily bread under difficult times. Having said that, it is becomes important to acknowledge that one cannot effectively support oneself in modern society without being subject to capitalism's dictates. Many people, especially non-artists, have the regrettable misconception that art and culture somehow existed in a Utopia outside of this kind of capitalism. This raises the question of how much capitalism influences art. 
In an article in response to John Molyneux’ The Dialectics of Art, political activist and author Chris Nineham argues that having to create and present art to an audience that will privately consume it not only puts a lot of pressure on an individual artist but also stifles their creativity. He agrees with John when he said that all art produced under a capitalist society is circumstantial. However, he believes “Once their work is produced even partially in response to external necessities, the artist is no longer in control of their own creativity”.

<b>Does capitalism or creating art to meet the egoistical needs of people in positions of power stifle creativity?  </b> <br>
Take for example, the art work produced during the Baroque period. In 1517, when Martin Luther questioned basic tenets of the Roman Church, including the ‘clergy’s exclusive right to grant salvation’, the church carefully curated and commissioned the Baroque art movement as an advertising campaign to systematically target the uneducated masses through art. The Baroque movement was a classic attempt to reinstate the catholic church’s fundamental teachings and combat the protestant criticism that turned the public against the catholic church. This could be evidently traced in the way the artworks from Baroque were created. Works of art created in the Baroque period were known to be dramatic, divine and vivid contrary to that of Renaissance. The artists were tasked to install a sense of belonging and connection to the divine inside the hearts of common people. To bring that out they created a sense of movement and made use of light and shadow in order to create dramatic realism. This, arguably required artists to use their creativity thus diminishing the point raised by Chris Nineham and the argument in question. 
Similar examples of using art as a means to convince common folks about certain beliefs of the government or the church can be seen in early art movements like the Renaissance or Gothic art period as well. However, the same practice when brought to a more modern context can be seen as the practice of ‘Art-Washing’ where Corporations employ or buy advertising spaces in order to validate and/or coverup their controversial beliefs or activities in order to meet their selfish demands i.e to continue to earn their profits.
